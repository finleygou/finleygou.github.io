# Graph-based Formation Control with Collision Avoidance via Policy-Guided Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract
This letter addresses the challenge of **formation
control with collision avoidance (FCCA)** in multi-agent systems
under **limited communication**, using a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) approach. We propose a novel training
framework that combines **Graph Transformer-based** information
aggregation, a **consensus theory-based guide policy**, and
hybrid **curriculum learning** regulators to enhance the scalability
and sample efficiency of the system. The key contributions
include: (1) the design of a MARL framework tailored for
FCCA, where agents are trained using local information only,
(2) the incorporation of a guide policy and curriculum learning
techniques to promote effective training, and (3) we conducted
extensive experiments in obstacle-cluttered environments with
varying agent numbers, including simulations and real-world
applications on **omnidirectional vehicles**, to showcase the robustness
and generalizability of our method. Besides, our
method is compared with the latest works on the FCCA
problem and demonstrates significant superiority. The findings
in this letter establish a strong foundation for further research
on policy-guided MARL tasks.

## Contributions
1. We propose a MARL training framework that leverages
a Graph Transformer for formation control with collision
avoidance under restricted communication, while
encoding different types of entities accordingly.

2. We integrate guide policy and curriculum learning
techniques to enhance sample efficiency and model
performance, and incorporate these strategies into multiple
training algorithms to assess the robustness.

3. We conduct experiments with varying numbers of
agents in cluttered obstacle environments to showcase
the scalability of our method. Additionally, real-world
experiments are carried out using omnidirectional vehicles
with different formation shapes.
