# Researches

<!-- TODO: Add research descriptions here with visualization. -->
<!-- Including Coverage control, 3D TAD game, flocking control, and encirclement interception. Coming soon.  -->

1. Coordinated Swarm Interception Method Based on Area Coverage and Adaptive Dynamic Programming, 2022. See brief work description [here](/researches/coverage_circle/).

2. Cooperative detection of a mobile area using multiple directional sensors, 2024. See brief work description [here](/researches/coverage_detect/).

3. Coverage based encirclement interception method via deep reinforcement learning, 2024. See brief work description [here](/researches/encirclement-guidance/).

4. Three-dimensional TAD game using deep reinforcement learning, 2025. See brief work description [here](/researches/3D-TAD/).

5. Swarm flocking control with collision avoidance via spatial-temporal GNN based deep reinforcement learning, 2025. See brief work description [here](/researches/flocking2025/).
